# etch-a-sketch
My etch a sketch project where i will demonstrate more of my skills with the DOM and loops
1. Create a basic edge a sketch with 16x16 squares
2. For squares use divs by createElement
3. For creating divs use loop that has to loop over 16x16 times divs will be 10 pixel in width and height
4. make the divs container divs will be 10px so container has to be 160x160 flex and make them wrap
5. change the div color once mouse enters the square
6. function get size for etch a sketch dimensions
7. when player clicks a button it outputs a prompt
8. store prompt in variable dimensions, return that variable
9. let user pick which color to use rgb or default color - store choice in variable and invoke it in change color function
